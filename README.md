# Portfolio

For This project I made my portfolio trying to replicate a synthwave style so it matches what i believe are my vibes.

there will be 2 CSS files, one for the parallax effect on the landing screen and one for general styling,

there are 2 media queries 1 for tablets and 1 for phones

there is as well 3 HTML files, each for a specific section of my webpage, which not only is required for me to do but i believe that will keep the order

The HTML is as semantic as I could think and CSS selectors are reused for the purpose of making the styles apply between diffrent files
