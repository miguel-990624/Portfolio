                        <h3>Developer</h3>
                        <p>Hi, My name is Miguel Angel Molina Gutierrez, and I am a front-end developer.<br />
                            I've started my studies this year at Riwi, formally at least. I am a self taught front-end developer, with minimal React, CSS, HTML expertise. But formally this is the first time I get to listen to lectures and do homework which is super exiting. I am doing my best at my training center and due to that, right now I get to do the role of a tutor as well.<br />
                            Before all this? ... Well, I am a 3D artist who grew tired of the industry. I love 3D mostly I use blender, Zbrush and 3DCoat for my models and work through all the production pipe line by myself, but I never got the satisfaction and mental challenge I get from programming, which is why I took the risk of doing a 180 on my career path. I still love 3D but now it's just a hobby, I have now something to look up to

                    <h2>About <br>Myself</h2>
                    <h3>Education</h3>
                    <p>
                        I am against all odds somewhat of an engineer, I did a major in digital entertainment, for the first 4 semester we went thtough the basic route and after the 5th we chose our career path, I centered my focus in animation. After I compleated my studies I did work on the field, but I choose to change to programming. <br />
                        I did spend almost 8 months studying by myself through Youtube, and i got to do some part of a certificate given by the meta team, where I got the chance to learn react into more dept, as well as realizing that was my calling in life. <br />
                        Fast forward to 2025 I got myself enrolled into Riwi, where I aim to become one of the best students of my class, it's been challenging but through the sheer will I have to succeed I believe I can do it.

                    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                    <p>
                        Hobbies, I am very much into gaming, I have played videogames since I was 8, I started playing pokemon due to my cousin being a huge influence in my life. Time kept going on but the passion and enthusiasm I feel still can be felt up until today.<br />
                        When I was 15 I got the chance to go to the US, and there I fell immediately in love with a TCG, it's called Magic: The gathering, and that has been my biggest hobby to the date. <br />
                        I as well do other activities such as Reading, I love fiction and fantasy, right now i am reading the Brandon Sanderson series of mistborn, and after this one I will be reading the Hannibal series.
